# Auth for axum

High-level [http auth](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication) extractors for [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum)

ðŸš¨ This crate provides an alternative to `TypedHeader<Authorization<..>>` which you may [use](https://docs.rs/axum-extra/latest/axum_extra/struct.TypedHeader.html) instead. Take a look at the fantastic [axum-login](https://github.com/maxcountryman/axum-login) crate if your looking for more robust session management. I will continue to maintain this crate.

## Usage

Bearer Authentication:

```rust
use axum_auth::AuthBearer;
 
/// Handler for a typical axum route, takes a `token` and returns it
async fn handler(AuthBearer(token): AuthBearer) -> String {
    format!("Found a bearer token: {}", token)
}
```

Basic Authentication:

```rust
use axum_auth::AuthBasic;
 
/// Takes basic auth details and shows a message
async fn handler(AuthBasic((id, password)): AuthBasic) -> String {
    if let Some(password) = password {
        format!("User '{}' with password '{}'", id, password)
    } else {
        format!("User '{}' without password", id)
    }
}
```

You can also define custom extractors, letting you return custom extractors, status codes, and messages to users if the auth fails. Check out the [crate documentation](https://docs.rs/axum-auth) for more in-depth information into how everything works!

## Installation

Simply place the following inside of your `Cargo.toml` file for axum:

```toml
[dependencies]
axum-auth = "0.8"
```

Our version follows axum since 0.7. You can also enable just basic/bearer auth via features. To enable just basic auth, you can add this to the `Cargo.toml` file instead:

```toml
[dependencies]
axum-auth = { version = "0.8", default-features = false, features = ["auth-basic"] }
```

If you're still using axum 0.5, use version 0.3. If you're still using axum 0.6, use version 0.4.

- This crate purposefully does not limit the maximum length of headers arriving so please ensure your webserver configurations are set properly.
