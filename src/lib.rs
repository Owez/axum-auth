//! High-level [http auth](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication) extractors for [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum)
//!
//! ðŸš¨ This crate provides an alternative to `TypedHeader<Authorization<..>>` which you should probably [use](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/struct.TypedHeader.html) instead. Take a look at the fantastic [axum-login](https://github.com/maxcountryman/axum-login) crate if your looking for more robust session management. I will continue to maintain this crate.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Take a look at the following structures:
//!
//! - **Basic auth: [AuthBasic]**
//! - **Bearer auth: [AuthBearer]**
//!
//! If you need to implement custom errors (i.e., status codes and messages), use these:
//!
//! - Custom basic auth: [AuthBasicCustom]
//! - Custom bearer auth: [AuthBearerCustom]
//!
//! That's all there is to it! Check out the [repository](https://github.com/owez/axum-auth) for contributing or some more documentation.
